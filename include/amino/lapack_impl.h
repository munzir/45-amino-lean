/** DGELSD computes the minimum-norm solution to a real linear least
 *  squares problem.
 *
 *  Minimizes \f$| b - A*x |\f$ using the singular value decomposition
 *  (SVD) of A. A is an M-by-N matrix which may be rank-deficient.
 *
 *  Several right hand side vectors b and solution vectors x can be
 *  handled in a single call; they are stored as the columns of the
 *  M-by-NRHS right hand side matrix B and the N-by-NRHS solution
 *  matrix X.
 *
 *  The problem is solved in three steps:
 *  - (1) Reduce the coefficient matrix A to bidiagonal form with
 *      Householder transformations, reducing the original problem
 *      into a "bidiagonal least squares problem" (BLS)
 *  - (2) Solve the BLS using a divide and conquer approach.
 *  - (3) Apply back all the Householder tranformations to solve
 *      the original least squares problem.
 *
 *  The effective rank of A is determined by treating as zero those
 *  singular values which are less than RCOND times the largest singular
 *  value.
 *
 *  The divide and conquer algorithm makes very mild assumptions about
 *  floating point arithmetic. It will work on machines with a guard
 *  digit in add/subtract, or on those binary machines without guard
 *  digits which subtract like the Cray X-MP, Cray Y-MP, Cray C-90, or
 *  Cray-2. It could conceivably fail on hexadecimal or decimal machines

 *          The dimension of the array WORK. LWORK must be at least 1.
 *          The exact minimum amount of workspace needed depends on M,

 *              12*N + 2*N*SMLSIZ + 8*N*NLVL + N*NRHS + (SMLSIZ+1)**2,
 *          if M is greater than or equal to N or
